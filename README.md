## üìù About project

The aim of this project is to prepare the prototype of interscholastic platform for learning
maths. We have created an interactive project of user interface. The main
part of the project is the internet platform. It consists of two integrated applications - a
server with a database and web application. It contains examples of various tasks for
students along with a test base of students in particular classes.

**_This repository contains only web application_**
